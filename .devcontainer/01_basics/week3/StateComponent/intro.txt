To make frontends easier to code, the concept of state came into the picture. You will see this more when we reach react.
There are three jargon we need to understand
1. State - The variable parts of an app.
2. Components - How to render  state on screen.
3. Rendering - Taking the state and rendering it on the DOM based on the components


1. In LinkedIn the skeleton of the post is the component
2. The variable part of the post such as the Image, Duration of the post, and Like count are the variable
    that is known as the state. This is stored in an Object and id jsut pushed to the component
