Axios is an external library that help us to write HTTP clients.
Initially we wrote two different lines to get the response and then converting the response into the json

In axios it converts the response into JSON automatically into a member variable called data

We do not need to require it becuase we use it in html. So we rather use the link into the src tag of script into the head tag
