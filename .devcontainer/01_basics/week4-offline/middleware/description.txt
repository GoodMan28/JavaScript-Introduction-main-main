ðŸ”¹ What is Express?
"Express is a routing and middleware web framework that has minimal functionality of its own."

This means Express doesnâ€™t do much by itself â€” its power comes from middleware functions that handle requests and responses.

ðŸ”¹ What is Middleware?
"An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls."

Middleware in Express refers to functions that process the request and response objects (req, res) in the application pipeline.

ðŸ”¹ What Middleware Functions Can Do:
They are versatile and can:

Execute any code â€“ Run any logic, like logging or authentication checks.

Modify the request or response â€“ Add data to req (e.g., user info) or modify the res (e.g., set headers).

End the request-response cycle â€“ Send a response to the client (res.send(), res.json(), etc.).

Call the next middleware â€“ Pass control to the next middleware using the next() function.

ðŸ”¹ Key Terms:
request object (req): Contains details about the clientâ€™s request.

response object (res): Used to send data back to the client.

next(): A function used to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

ðŸ§  Summary
Middleware is the core building block of Express. Each middleware function processes incoming requests in a chain, deciding whether to:
act on the request,
pass it along,
or end the cycle.
