-A state management library for React that provides a way to manage global state with fine-grained control.

-Recoil minimizes unnecessary renders by only re-rendering components that depend on changed atoms

## Key concepts in recoil

- **Atoms:** Atoms are units of state that can be read from and written to from any component. When an atomâ€™s state changes, all components that subscribe to that atom will re-render.
- **Selectors:** Functions that derive state from atoms or other selectors, allowing for computed state.
