The username is encode to the JWT when we sign in
The opposite happens when we hit the /me EP

Here in jwt we dont need to lookup for the username into the DB after the user hits /me EP.

We still have to lookup for different data into the DB.
But the auth work for checking whether the username is present into the DB is avoided.
We can directly decode the username from the token
