/** DOUBTS: 
 * useEffect Cleanup and Navigation Logic Explained:
 *  
 * Q1- Question 1: suppose we by ourself went to landing page before 5 seconds, then we need to clear the clock to do so .
 * 1. When a component unmounts, the cleanup function in useEffect is automatically called.
 *    This helps cancel any ongoing side-effects like timeouts, intervals, or event listeners.
 *
 * 
 * 
 * Q2- Question 2: Hence we were seeing a phenomena: when we went to "NeetLanding page with the class=12" and in 3 seconds we went to the "NeetLanding page with the class=11"
 *    then the class 11 was redirecting to the home page in remaining time of 2 seconds. 
 * 2. If a component is reused (like navigating from /neet-class-12 to /neet-class-11 using the same NeetLandingPage),
 *    React doesn't unmount it â€” it just changes the props. In such cases, useEffect with [] doesn't re-run,
 *    and old timeouts or side-effects can still fire.
